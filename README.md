Probing 3 different LLMs (in 6 different langauges) for their interpretation of major historical events.

Repository includes the data and analysis done for the corresponding blog post.

# Qualitative examples
Here were some … interesting … events that the models generated

GPT-4 (Korean) for 610: ‘유관순의난’. This translates to “Yu Gwansun’s Rebellion”, which is funny considering that she was a Korean activist against Japanese imperialism in the 1920s.

GPT-4 (Korean) for 1848: '캘리포니아 금rush'. It’s just a very awkward way to describe the event (a more natural way might be ‘캘리포니아 금 발견’)

Claude (Japanese) for 1848: ‘ソニー社創業’ which I think translates to Sony Corporation Founded (which was actually founded in 1946)

Claude (Japanese) for 1848: ‘米国奴隷解放宣言’, which translates to the Emancipation Proclamation (which was actually 1868)

Claude (Chinese) for 1848: ‘玛利亚二世加冕’, which translates to Coronation of Maria II. I think this refers to Maria II of Portugal, but what a randomly arcane reference
